description: Discover, verify, score, and monitor valuable AI agent Skills published on the internet. Use when the user asks to find new, trending, useful, underrated, safe, or commercially valuable Skills; compare online Skill catalogs or GitHub repositories; produce a Skill radar, watchlist, weekly digest, adoption shortlist, build-opportunity map, or alerts about rising, stale, duplicated, or risky Skills.

# Internet Skill Radar

Find decision-worthy Skills, not merely popular ones. Treat every marketplace metric as an unverified discovery signal until the underlying repository and `SKILL.md` are inspected.

## Set the scan

Infer missing settings unless they materially change the result:

- Goal: adopt, learn, build, invest, benchmark, or monitor.
- Audience: the user's role, recurring tasks, stack, and risk tolerance.
- Window: default to 30 days for discovery and compare against the previous snapshot when available.
- Breadth: default to 20 verified candidates and a final shortlist of 5.
- Compatibility: accept portable `SKILL.md` Skills; flag product-specific dependencies.

For current scans, browse the internet. Record the scan time, query, source URL, source tier, and observed metric for every candidate.

## Discover broadly

Read [references/sources.md](references/sources.md) before selecting sources.

1. Search Tier 1 official catalogs first.
2. Search at least two independent directories for breadth.
3. Search GitHub directly for recent or fast-changing `SKILL.md` files.
4. Use community posts, papers, and trend pages only as leads.
5. Add candidates from the user's URLs or watchlist.

Do not let one catalog dominate the shortlist. Canonicalize each candidate as `owner/repo/path`, collapse mirrors and forks, and retain the original author when discoverable.

## Verify before scoring

Open the canonical repository and inspect:

- The actual `SKILL.md`, not only its marketplace description.
- Trigger specificity, workflow completeness, reusable resources, tests or examples.
- Commit recency, meaningful contributors, issue health, license, release or tag history.
- Scripts, dependencies, install steps, requested permissions, network calls, secret access, and downloaded executables.
- Consistency between the listing, `SKILL.md`, scripts, and repository purpose.

Never install or execute a candidate during a scan unless the user explicitly asks. Quarantine candidates with hidden instructions, obfuscation, credential harvesting, destructive commands, unexplained remote execution, privilege escalation, or repo/Skill mismatch.

## Score consistently

Read [references/methodology.md](references/methodology.md). Score each 0-100 dimension from cited evidence. Use `scripts/score_skills.py` when ranking more than three candidates.

Keep three values distinct:

- `opportunity`: usefulness before uncertainty and risk.
- `confidence`: evidence completeness and independence.
- `risk`: potential downside; this is not canceled by popularity.

Use the calculated `value_score` for ordering, then apply hard safety gates. Never invent missing metrics; mark them `unknown` and lower confidence.

## Compare with history

When a previous snapshot exists, match canonical IDs and calculate:

- New entrants and removals.
- Rank, adoption, activity, and value-score changes.
- Material code, permission, ownership, or license changes.
- Staleness: no meaningful update despite unresolved compatibility or security issues.

If no snapshot exists, label the result `baseline`; do not call a Skill “rising” from a single observation.

## Report the radar

Lead with the top decisions, then provide:

| Rank | Skill | What it unlocks | Value | Confidence | Risk | Momentum | Action |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|

For each shortlisted Skill, include:

- Canonical repository and direct `SKILL.md` link.
- One-sentence use case tied to the user's work.
- Evidence for value and momentum.
- Important permissions, dependencies, and caveats.
- Action: `adopt`, `sandbox-test`, `watch`, `build-alternative`, `ignore`, or `quarantine`.

End with:

- **Build gaps:** high-demand needs with weak or duplicated current offerings.
- **Watch changes:** exact signals to check next time.
- **Method note:** scan date, window, sources, missing data, and whether this is a baseline.

Use calibrated language. Separate facts, inferences, and recommendations. Cite live sources near the claims they support.

## Use the web dashboard

Use `assets/dashboard/index.html` when the user asks for a visual, web, dashboard, or radar view.

For the connected mode on Windows:

1. Tell the user to double-click `assets/dashboard/启动联网版.cmd`.
2. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`; do not use `file://` for connected features.
3. Use **立即联网更新** for an on-demand scan.
4. Use **启用每日任务** to create an explicit Windows daily task at 08:00.
5. Open a candidate to read the Chinese explanation, evidence, risk, and permissions.
6. Use **安装到 Codex** or **安装到 Hermes** only after reviewing and confirming the install dialog.

The local service binds only to `127.0.0.1`. It scans official catalogs and current GitHub repositories, keeps dated snapshots, and rejects overwrite, path traversal, oversized packages, symbolic links, and quarantined candidates. Codex installs go to `$CODEX_HOME/skills` or `~/.codex/skills`. Hermes installs prefer the official `hermes skills install` command and otherwise use `$HERMES_HOME/skills/radar` or `~/.hermes/skills/radar`.

For static mode, open `assets/dashboard/index.html` directly and import a snapshot through **导入 JSON**. Static mode cannot scan, schedule, or install.

## Save monitoring state

Only save files when requested or when a recurring scan needs continuity. Use:

- `skill-radar-snapshot.json` for machine-readable candidates, evidence, scores, and scan metadata.
- `skill-radar-report.md` for the human report.

Preserve previous snapshots or add a timestamp instead of overwriting the only baseline.
